# RazorPizzeria
## _The project is structured as follows:_

### Homepage:
- The journey begins on the homepage.
- From here, users will find a link either within the body content or the navigation bar leading to the Pizza Sales page.

### Pizza Sales Page:
- On the Pizza Sales page, users can choose between pre-made pizza options.
- Alternatively, they can opt for a custom pizza by selecting this option.

### Checkout Process:
- Choosing a pre-made pizza will allow users to proceed directly to the checkout page.
- Opting for a custom pizza will redirect users to a pizza customization form on the checkout page.
- At the checkout page, the final price is calculated based on the pizza selection.
- Users will then have the option to confirm their order.

### Thank You Page:
- After confirming the order, users will be directed to the Thank You page to acknowledge the completion of their order.
